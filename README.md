# Topical

Topical is an educational platform that helps users create, manage, and study structured lesson plans. It uses large language models and web crawling to generate learning materials from source content and provides a collaborative environment for educators and students.

### Architecture & Features

- **AI Content Microservice (FastAPI & Python)**: Integrated Google Gemini LLM and crawl4ai for context-aware crawling, generation, relevance scoring, and prompt optimization, providing high-quality educational content with subsecond inference.
- **Data & Auth Backend (Bun & Drizzle ORM)**: Built bun microservices for OAuth2 via Kinde Auth, secure file storage, and user management; used Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL.
- **MDX Authoring UI (React & TypeScript)**: Created a React/TS front end with TanStack Router/Query, featuring a live MDX editor with JSX previews, drag-and-drop media, and component hydration.
